# 4thYearRealWorldModelingProject

This was a group project developed for the Real World Modelling module
in 4th year for which we were to recreate a game and thus we have
attempted to recreate the first world from Super Bomber Man 2.

The project has been developed in collaboration with Jonelle Lawler, Jake Comiskey and Mateusz Stepien
